<p><h3>Research Statement:</h3></p>
<p>My primary interests are the physical sciences, specifically the combination of optics, laser science, and nanotechnology. 
 I am very interested in the small scale, and the non-intuitive interactions that take place on this level. 
 The wide range of laser interaction with materials, from low power absorption and excitation of phonons, plasmons and fluorescence to high power ablation and two-photon processes is a field which I long had an interest and now eagerly explore. 
 These interests have led me to the field of nonlinear optical imaging, and am working on new forms of intrinsic contrast for microscopy.

<p><b><a href="http://www.chem.duke.edu/~wwarren/" target="_blank">Warren Research Group</a> - <a href="http://phy.duke.edu/" target="_blank">Duke Univeristy</a> (2010-Present):</b> I currently work to design and implement microscopy with new forms of intrinsic contrast. As an example, I have used the nonlinear index of refraction (where the index depends on the intensity of light incident on it, known as self-phase modulation) to image unstained cells, tissue phantoms, and have done depth imaging on some samples. With another student, we have developed a <a href="http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?URI=LS-2011-LMC5" target="_blank">pulse shaper</a> that operates at 4,000x the previous rate, vastly increasing our ability to perform imaging with this technique.

<p><b><a href="http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~sl1/" target="_blank">Link Research Group</a> - <a href="http://physics.rice.edu/" target="_blank">Rice Univeristy</a> (2007-2009):</b> I developed a <a href="sms.html">program</a> to locate and track nanocars from images generated by a scanning confocal microscope. Collected data using a scanning confocal microscope and polarized photomultiplier tube setup. Coordinated upgrade of RHK (scan controller) unit, improving performance. Presently, I am working on my senior thesis; research into plasmon lifetime dependence on the environment via joint spectral amplitude and phase information.

<p><b><a href="http://www.ees.lanl.gov/" target="_blank">Earth and Environmental Science</a> - <a href="http://www.lanl.gov/" target="_blank">LANL</a> (2003-2008):</b> I worked with <a href="http://www.lanl.gov/orgs/ees/ees11/geophysics/staff/tencate/tencate.shtml" target="_blank">Dr. James TenCate</a> performing numerous stress-strain measurements, which characterized a wide variety of rocks. I also developed a <a href="pmspace.html">PM Space Simulator</a> to model and extract PM spaces from the data. I also performed several non-linear dynamics experiments on various rocks.

<p><b><a href="http://www.siemens-foundation.org/en/competition.htm" target="_blank">Siemens-Westinghouse Competition</a> (2005):</b> <a href="http://www.siemens-foundation.org/en/competition/2004_winners/kevin_claytor.htm" target="_blank">I advanced</a> to the highest level in the Siemens Competition for Math Science and Technology with a project for non-destructive materials analysis with lasers.
</p>

<p><b><a href="http://www.societyforscience.org/isef/" target="_blank">Science Fair Experience</a> (2000-2005):</b> I performed independent research in high school, consisting of using a homebuilt power supply and nanosecond laser. Using this setup, investigations in laser ablation and acoustic wave generation were investigated. The later particularly for uses in non-destructive materials analysis.
