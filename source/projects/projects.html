<p><h3>Toblerone Clock</h3></p>
<p>The <a href="toblerone.html">toblerone clock</a> is a 21 element dual-color LED grid made from toblerone boxes.
 In addition to telling time, you can tweet messages to it and have it play out the game of life.

<p><h3>Nonlinear Oscillator</h3></p>
<p>My <a href="nonlinear.html">nonlinear lego oscillator</a> is an extensive toy physics system.
 It is a driven and damped harmonic oscillator.
 Since it's coupling to the drive arm is nonlinear (a rubber band), you can get interesting dynamics.

<p><h3>Tangicode</h3></p>
<p><a href="tangicode.html">Tangicode</a> is the project I worked on for the Triangle Startup Weekend, Maker Edition 2014.
 The idea is to go from product idea to minimum product and pitch in ~48 hrs.
 Our projet was on making logic and programming concepts accessible to younger kids.
 We were doing this by having a series of blocks they could interact with which would then be interpreted and control a video game character.
