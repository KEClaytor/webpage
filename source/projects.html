<p><h3>Toblerone Clock</h3></p>
<p>This is a 21 element clock made from toblerone boxes. Powered by a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>, it has a <a href="https://twitter.com/tobleroneclock">twitter account</a> that it monitors and then prints the tweets, character by character, on its clock face.</p>
<p>You can get the source code off of <a href="https://github.com/KEClaytor/HexPi">GitHub</a>. Here's a cool video of it in action:</p>

<p><h3>Nonlinear Oscillator</h3></p>
<p>One of the coolest things that I like about physics is how accessible it can be with some fairly simple experiments. 
Here I've built a pendulum out of Legos, it has a rubber band to provide a damping force, and a motor to drive it. 
Despite its relative simplicity, we can observe some fairly complicated behavior, such as bifurcation 
(different behavior for the same conditions).</p>
<p>As a project for a nonlinear dynamics class I took, I constructed this driven, damped oscillator. 
It exhibits hysteresis in the resonance frequency. 
For example, if you increase the frequency that you're driving it at, 
you won't always get the same amplitude of oscillation as if you had reached 
the same frequency by decreasing the drive frequency from something higher.</p>
<br/>Here's the <link>final report</link>.
<br/>You can download the <link>video analysis code here</link>.
<br/>Here's a video of the oscillator, along with the tracking of the dots, and the illustration of the hysteresis effect:
