Welcome to the main hub of my web presence.
 I'm currently a graduate student at Duke University, studying physics under Warren Warren.
 On this page you'll find a wide variety of my work, here's a quick overview of things you may find interesting:

<p><h3>Academic Work</h3></p>
<p>
You can read up on the previous <a href="research.html">research projects</a> I've been involved in.
 My <a href="publications.html">publication list</a> can also give you a quick overview of my work.

<p><h3>Cool Projects</h3></p>
<p>
I enjoy to tinker on my own as well.
 Most of these projects mix a hardware and software component, to make something that is interactive.
 Take a look at the <a href="projects.html">Toblerone Clock</a> for instance.

<p><h3>Programming Projects</h3></p>
<p>
I've worked in a variety of languages from <a href="programs.html">MATLAB to Python to Mathematica</a>.
 I host some of these results one this page, and others can be found around the web.
