<p><a href="colony.html"><b>Colony Counter:</b></a>
A unique program that interfaces with hardware. 
This program uses an attached webcam to image petri dishes, 
and then performs watershed and/or regional maximum analysis 
to separate and count the colonies present on the plate. 
This was specifically developed with high density, 
small colony size (less than 5 mm diameter) plates in mind.

<p><a href="sms.html"><b>Single Molecule Visualizer:</b></a>
This program is by far my largest and most complete project to date. 
It batch processes a series of images for molecules, 
fitting them to the point spread function. 
Once fit, it determines trajectories, 
chooses the most optimal trajectory set, 
and then analyzes these and displays the diffusion constants of the molecules.

<p><a href="pmspace.html"><b>PM Space Solver & Simulator:</b></a>
Initially a program to demonstrate, for a poster session, 
how Preisach-Mayergoyez space functions and how it can be 
used to describe rock stress-strain experiments. 
However, with a bit of extra work, it became a tool for 
inverting the stress-strain curve into a PM space and 
using the PM space to predict such stress-strain phenomena as inner loops.

<p><a href="sudoku.html"><b>Sudoku Solver:</b></a>
A program that solves sudoku puzzles. 
I am continually improving on the algorithm and challenging it with harder and harder puzzles.
</p>
<p><a href="othello.html"><b>Othello:</b></a>
An implementation of the classic game I wrote to test my ability to write a recursive solving routine. 
While perhaps not the smartest opponent, I still enjoy playing this one.
</p>
<p><a href="connect.html"><b>Connect Four:</b></a>
I have used the connect four game as an excellent program with with to teach the principles of GUI's,
as it involves several buttons and drop-down boxes, 
updating the main window with an animation, 
and interfacing with another program (that which computes the computer's move).
</p>
<p><a href="mtpe.html"><b>MTPE Warp:</b></a>
One of the earliest programs I wrote. 
The program has proved its usefulness, however, 
as the batch processor was subsequently used for the 
Sinlge Molecule Visualizer program as well as the Colony Counting program.
