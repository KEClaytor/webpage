<p/>
<p><b>Introduction and Download</b>
<br> This is a program that I wrote for my REU in the summer of 2008 at the <a href="http://illinois.edu/"><font class="lightbg"">University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign</font></a> for <a href="http://www.physics.uiuc.edu/people/golding/"><font class="lightbg"">Prof. Ido Golding</font></a>.  It interfaces with a webcam attached to the computer, uses it to capture an image of a bacterial plate and counts the number of colonies on the dish. <br>
<p><a href="mcrdownload.html">MCR Installer</a> - The MATLAB component runtime that must be installed <b>before</b> running the program installer.
<br><a href="exe/Counter_pkg.exe"><font class="lightbg"">Counter_pkg</font></a> - Standalone executable (windows only) <br>
<a href="mfiles/colony.zip"><font class="lightbg"">Matlab code</font></a> - .zip of m files <br>
<br>
<b>Installation</b>
<br>If the Matlab Runtime has not been installed download and install the Matlab runtime file. Then download the counter_pkg.exe program and run it. This will create counter.exe which is the standalone application. Alternatively you can download the Matlab files in a .zip package and run from the Matlab command prompt. </p>
