<p>A little page to put up stuff related to the MTPE project I'm working on.  The status of the main GUI is as follows;
<br>--Functional batch processor
<br>--Batch Processing from mid-Sequence
<br>--Functional option selection
<br>--Functional full image resizer
<br>--Functional full image cropper and resizer
<p><a href=mfiles/MTPEWarp.m>MTPE Dome Converter</a> -- Under development and subject to change
<br><a href=mfiles/MTPEWarpR5.m>Revision 5</a> -- Old versions
<br><a href=mfiles/MTPEWarpR4.m>Revision 4</a>
<p><a href="MTPEUserGuide.pdf">User's Guide and Manual</a> -- Being Written.
<p>I was also asked to write a second GUI which applies the batch processor from the first to a dedicated cropping / trimming application.
<br>I realize that I could have just written it into MTPEWarp, and indeed tried this, however, things were getting just a might too confusing in there with it as well, so it took on life as a spin-off.  It's status is as follows;
<br>--Functional batch processor
<br>--Batch Processing from mid-Sequence
<br>--Functional inner image cropper
<p><a href=mfiles/MTPETrim.m><font class="lightbg">MTPE Trimmer</font></a> -- Under development and subject to change
<br><a href=mfiles/trimdemo.jpg><font class="lightbg">Accessory file</font></a> -- Required for the preview image to display.
<br>A note on installation; save both the .m file and the image to the same folder.  It is recommended you not put the image with the other images you are going to convert.

<br>Revision 6 - Fixed a minor bug in the preview that wasn't acutally rendering it until it had finished the transform, and added titles.
<br>Revision 5 - The preview images now appear at the beginning of the transform sequence.
<br>Revision 4 - One can now start conversions from the middle of a sequence using the Offset feature
<br>Revision 3 - GUI has been updated again but with the crop and resize feature.
<br>Revision 2 - A newer version of the GUI.  In addition to allowing easy batch processing of great numbers of files, this one sports a fully functional resize feature.  Coming soon - a crop and resize!
<br>Revision 1 - An image displaying the current status of the GUI.  Currently capable of reading in, transforming, and saving multiple files.

<br>Revision 3 - A more directed program that is meant as an accessory to MTPEWarp.  This Trimming program takes images before they are dome masters - when they have extra black space - and trims the excess off of them.  Again, the main advantage here is the batch processor.
