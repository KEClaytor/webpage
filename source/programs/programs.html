Most of my python scripts are availble on GitHub. These include:
<ul>
    <li>Project Euler solutions (don't cheat now!)</li>
    <li>The Toblerone Twitter Clock @tobleroneclock</li>
    <li>Make a Fantasy Football Roster (players can't have an arrest record)</li>
</ul>

I've made a few of my mathematica demonstrations availble at the
 <a href="http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/">wolfram demonstration project</a>.
</p>
<p><a href="matlab.html"><b>MATLAB:</b></a>
Perhaps the most numerous projects are those I've written in MATLAB.
 I host the source for most of these on this website, feel free to download and modify as per the license.
