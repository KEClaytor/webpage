<p><h3>Simple Webpage Generator</h3></p>
<p>This website was <a href="https://github.com/KEClaytor/webpage">put together</a> by having python jam a bunch of content files into a template file.
 I know there are existing frameworks for this, but this was quick, simple, and fit well into my existing system.

<p><h3>Toblerone Clock</h3></p>
<p>Check out the <a href="projects.html">projects page</a> for a more thorough description of the Toblerone Clock.

<p><h3>Project Euler Soluions</h3></p>
<p>I used <a href="http://projecteuler.net/">project euler</a> as a practical primer to learn python.
 That is I forced myself to learn python (and git) by solving Project Euler problems.
 I think it's somewhat interesting to look at how <a href="https://github.com/KEClaytor/Euler">my python code improves</a> as I solve the problems.
 I'd recommend this as a good way of picking up a new language. Just no cheating now!

<p><h3>Twitter Word Cloud</h3></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/KEClaytor/twitter-cloud">This script</a> was a twitter streaming test (and a bit on learning pygame graphics).
 It asks for tweets containing specific keywords and then forms a word-cloud from the words found in those tweets.

<p><h3>Fantasy Football Roster</h3></p>
<p>I don't much care for fantasy football, but after being drafted into a league, I figured I might as well make the best of it.
 <a href="https://github.com/KEClaytor/FFRoster">This script</a> was how I chose my team.
 We were using a bididng system and this script suggests players and points based on past performance and predicted future performance
 (by suggested bidding cost).
 <br/>But I apply an additional constraint that the players must not have an arrest record.
 <br/>...needless to say I haven't won the pool yet. But I still have my moral high-ground ;)
